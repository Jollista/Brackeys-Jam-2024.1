Hey! Didn't expect anyone'd ever read this, but hi! This is the source code for a game
I made for the [Brackeys Gam Jam](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-11) with the theme
> WHAT'S BEHIND THE DOOR?
I didn't have a lot of immediate ideas, but the one I settled on was like a dungeon
crawl kinda thing. Kicking down doors, killing monsters, finding loot. Munchkin kinda
stuff. So what I did was I quickly whipped together what is essentially like, a Blades
in the Dark hack and then I started implementing that in Godot 4.

## Inspiration
Stress mechanic and (for the most part) dice rolls lovingly stolen from [Forged in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/stress-trauma).

Resource points heavily inspired by [CBR+PNK](https://emanoelmelo.itch.io/cbrpnk-core)'s
inventory system.
